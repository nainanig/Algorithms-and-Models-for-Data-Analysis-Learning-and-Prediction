# Algorithms-and-Models-for-Data-Analysis-Learning-and-Prediction
In this we will apply machine learning algorithms and statistical models to data with the ultimate goal of being able to predict the outcome for a certain query or classify data according
to certain criteria. 
More specifically, we will explore algorithms discussed in Chapter 3 of Doing Data
Science textbook [1]: linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, k-means.
